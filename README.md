# Google Maps Route Chooser

This repository contains an example of how to leverage the Google Maps
Javascript API to build a web page form that allows an user to chose a
route between a starting point and a destination.

A route can be chosen by either writing down the starting point and
destination on the respective input boxes, or either by clicking on the
map.  The user interaction tries to stay as close as possible to the one
provided by the directions page on Google Maps, as users are likely to
be familiar with the later one.

The example also explains what needs to be done on the client side to
store a route in a database, and to redisplay a stored route in the map
canvas.
