# route-chooser

This repository contains an example of how to build a web page form that
allows an user to chose a route between a starting point and a
destination.  The route will then be shown using the Google Maps public
API.

A route can be chosen by writing down the starting point and destination
on input boxes, or clicking on the map.  The user interaction tries to
stay as close as possible to the one provided by the directions page on
Google Maps, as users are likely to be familiar with the later one.
